# Stereo_Camera_System

In a stereo camera system, two cameras are placed horizontally at a fixed
distance apart to capture two images of the same scene from slightly different
perspectives.

1. Given a stereo image pair, compute the disparity map using any stereo
matching algorithm (e.g., block matching or semi-global matching).
2. Use the computed disparity map to estimate the depth of objects in the scene.
Assume the baseline distance and focal length are provided.
3. Visualize the depth map and provide an analysis of its accuracy. Discuss
potential challenges in disparity estimation, such as occlusion, repetitive
patterns, and noise in real-world applications.
